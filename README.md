# Customer-Churn-for-Telecom-Services
Built a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning in the telecom industry, aiding proactive retention efforts.

# Project description
In the ever-evolving landscape of telecommunications, retaining customers is paramount. Customer churn, the rate at which customers discontinue their services, can have a significant impact on a telecom company's bottom line. To address this critical challenge, I embarked on a data-driven journey to predict and understand customer churn for a telecom services provider.

# Business Case:
The primary objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that could identify customers at risk of churning. By proactively identifying these customers, telecom companies can tailor retention strategies, reduce churn, and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction and revenue.

# Analytical Approach:
**Data Collection and Preprocessing**: The project began with the acquisition of a comprehensive dataset from the telecom company. The dataset included various customer attributes, such as contract details, monthly charges, and customer demographics. Data preprocessing steps involved handling missing values, data type conversions, and encoding categorical variables.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To gain insights into the dataset, I conducted exploratory data analysis. This involved statistical summaries, visualizations, and understanding the distribution of key variables. EDA helped identify patterns and relationships within the data.
**Feature Selection:** After EDA, I selected relevant features that would be used in building the predictive model. Key features included senior citizen status, tenure, and monthly charges.
**Model Building:** The heart of the project was the construction of a predictive model. I chose to implement a Logistic Regression model for its simplicity and interpretability. The model was trained on historical data, with the target variable being whether a customer churned or not.
**Model Evaluation:** The model's performance was evaluated using classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, a confusion matrix was visualized using a heatmap to illustrate the model's ability to correctly classify customers.

# Key Insights:
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 80%, indicating its ability to predict customer churn effectively.
Precision for predicting customers who did not churn ('0') was notably higher than for predicting churn ('1'), suggesting a stronger ability to identify non-churning customers.
The model's recall for predicting churn was lower, indicating that it sometimes missed actual churn cases. This suggests an opportunity for further model improvement.

# Impact:
The insights gained from this project can drive several impactful actions for the telecom company:
**Proactive Retention Strategies:** By identifying customers at risk of churning, the company can implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers, discounts, or improved customer service.
Resource Allocation: The company can allocate resources more efficiently by focusing on high-risk customers, potentially reducing marketing costs.
**Enhanced Customer Satisfaction:** Customers who are retained are likely to be more satisfied, leading to improved brand loyalty and long-term revenue growth.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the power of data analytics in addressing real-world business challenges. By predicting customer churn, the telecom company can take proactive steps to mitigate churn's adverse effects and build a more resilient and customer-centric business.
